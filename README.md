\* (Oh, right, this is just a work-in-progress modding tool geared toward (but not limited to) UNDERTALE/DELTARUNE by Toby Fox.)

## Features
* Right now, reading/writing the barebones data file is in progress. It's really early in development...
* Planned features include an actual editor, a superior editing mode for modding purposes, and eventually decompilation/compilation (potentially).

## Special Thanks
* Msnshame and Agentalex9 for assistance in creating the icon for the tool. Additional thanks to the Underminers Discord server members for being there to come up with the name, as well.
* Previous GameMaker/Undertale data format research and tools
